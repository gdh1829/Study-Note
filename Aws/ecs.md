Amazon ECS
===
- Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) is a highly scalable, fast container management service that makes it easy to run, stop, and manage Docker containers on a cluster.   
- You can host your cluster on a serverless infrastructure that is managed by Amazon ECS by launching your services or tasks using the Fargate launch type.  
- For more control, you can host your tasks on a cluster of Amazon EC2 instances taht you manage by using the EC2 launch type.
- ECS can be used to create a consistent deployment and build experience, manage, and scale batch and **Extract-Transform-Load (ETL)** workloads, and build sophisticated application architectures on a microservices model.
- Amazon ECS is a regional service.
