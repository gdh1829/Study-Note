- A managed cluster platform that simplifies running big data frameworks, such as Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark, on AWS to process and analyze vast amounts of data.
- You can process data for analytics purposes and business intelligence workloads using EMR together with Apache Hive and Apache Pig.
- You can use EMR to transform and move large amounts of data into and out of other AWS data stores and datbases

## Features
- EMR Notebooks provide a managed environment, based on Jupyter, to help users prepare and visualize data, collaborate with peers, build applications, and perform interactive analysis using EMR clusters. 
- EMR enables you to quickly and easily provision as much capacity as you need, and automatically or manually add and remove capacity.
- You can leverage multiple data stores, including S3, the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), and DynamoDB.
- EMR supports powerful and proven _Hadoop_ tools such as _Hive_, _Pig_, _HBase_, and _Impala_. Additionally, it can run distributed computing frameworks besides Hadoop MapReduve such as _Spark_ or _Presto_ using bootstrap actions. You can also use _Hue_ and _Zeppelin_ as GUIs for interacting with applications on your cluster.
