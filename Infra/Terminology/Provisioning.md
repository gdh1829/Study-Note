Provisioning
===

Provisioning provides equipment, software or services to customers, users, employees or IT personnel and has contexts in computing, computer networking and telecommunications. In a computing context, provisioning is divided into the following subsets:  

* Grid computing provisioning
* SAN(Storage Area Network) provisioning
* Server provisioning
* User provisioning
* Internet access provisioning

Provisioning is the fourth step in the Operations, Adminstration, Maintenance and Provisioning (OAMP) management framework.
