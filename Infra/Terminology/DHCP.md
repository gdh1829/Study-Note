# DHCP

## What it is

- standard protocol known as `Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol(DHCP)`.
- __DHCP Server__: network server that automatically provides and assigns IP addresses, default gateways and other network parameters to client devices. It relies on the standard protocol knwon as DHCP to respond to broadcast queries by clients.

## What DHCP server does

- sends the required network parameters for clients to properly communicate on the network. Without it, the network administrator has to manually set up every client that joins the network, which can be cumbersome, especially in large networks.
- usually assigns each client with a unique dynamic IP address, which changes when the client's lease for that IP address has expired.
